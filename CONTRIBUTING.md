## Contributing to git-alias-helper

First off, thank you for considering contributing to git-alias-helper! It's people like you that make git-alias-helper such a great tool.

### 1. Where do I go from here?

If there is a bug or a feature you want to add, it's usually best to start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/cthonney/git-alias-helper/issues) in the repository. Even if you think it's relatively minor, it's helpful to know what people are working on. Mention in the issue that you are looking to address it so that it can be assigned to you.

For something that is bigger, like a new feature, comment on the existing issue or create a new one to have some discussion on the topic before starting.

### 2. Fork & create a branch

Fork the [git-alias-helper repository](https://github.com/cthonney/git-alias-helper) and create a branch with a descriptive name. A good branch name would be (where issue #X is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b feature/X-short-description
```

### 3. Get the test suite running

Make sure you're able to run the script and verify that it's functioning as expected.

### 4. Make your changes

Make the changes, and ensure that they are well-documented. Your code should be clean, well-organized, and understandable.

### 5. Stay updated

Ensure that your fork is kept [up-to-date](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) with the main repository.

### 6. Make a Pull Request

Before making a PR, make sure your code follows the coding standards and conventions used in the project. Include a descriptive message with references to the issue you were working on.

Make a Pull Request from your forked repository to the main git-alias-helper repository.

### 7. Code review

At least one other person will need to review your changes, and possibly several. Be ready to address any feedback or questions that are raised during review.
